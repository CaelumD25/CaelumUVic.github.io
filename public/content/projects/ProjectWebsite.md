As stated in the introduction, I created this website to show off some of the projects I’ve worked on and my experiences throughout my academic journey. 

This website was created with [React]({"https://react.dev"}), [Framer Motion]({"https://www.framer.com/motion/"}), and a little bit of [Bootstrap 5]({"https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/"}). I’ve always loved the aesthetic of the Nordic nations, so I designed this website with the [Nord]({"https://www.nordtheme.com"}) theme, which I fell in love with on my Linux machine and then added a touch of animation, courtesy of [Framer Motion]({"https://www.framer.com/motion/"}).
