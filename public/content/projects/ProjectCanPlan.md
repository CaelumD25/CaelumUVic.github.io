[CanPlan](https://www.canassist.ca/EN/main/programs/our-technologies/museum/canplan.html) is an application meant to help people who may struggle to complete tasks independently. I worked on a refreshed cross-platform version of CanPlan during my co-op at CanAssist, where I brought the application to fruition and release. CanPlan was developed using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) using a SQLite database for local data storage. While CanPlan is not a particularly complex application, the constraints(such as only being allowed to use local services) the project operated under made some development quite challenging.

_As of this writing, this application has not been updated in either the Apple or Android app stores. Once it is I will add a link to this card._
