In my recently taken AI course, we were tasked with creating a final project. For that project, my team and I decided to
recreate the classic video game Pacman, using modern AI approaches.

Using the [Godot game engine](https://godotengine.org), we recreated the game, and then in order to do the AI
functionalities we had to connect it to a Python program using a custom REST API and relay server
using [Flask]({"https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/"}). This project required a lot of creative problem-solving
due to the limited networking functionalities of the Godot game engine.
