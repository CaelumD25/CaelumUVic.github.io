Propinquity is an app for IOS and Android to help you stay in contact with your friends.
I came up with this idea when I was graduating from university and I wanted to make sure that without the structure of
school, I was still making time for people not presently in my life. This app is developed
with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) for easy
cross-platform development.

_As of last update, this app is still a WIP_
