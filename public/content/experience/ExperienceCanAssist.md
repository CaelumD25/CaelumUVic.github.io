### Software Developer Co-op

At CanAssist, I worked as a solo Full Stack Software Developer where my work revolved around the development of a refreshed IOS and Android application called CanPlan. CanPlan is a to-do list application made for people who may struggle to complete tasks independently(brain injuries, attention disorders, etc.) if you'd like to read more about CanPlan, you can find that on the projects page. Throughout my coop, I brought the CanPlan application to fruition, which involved me performing the following tasks:

- Presenting at weekly stand-up meetings about the progress of my Projects.
- Front-end design, development, and manual testing.
- Back-end development and unit testing.
- Database design, restructuring, and upgrading.
- Technical and user-focused documentation development.
- Deployment to Apple and Google ecosystems.
