At CanAssist, I worked independently as a Full Stack Developer to rebuild CanPlan, a to-do list app for individuals with
brain injuries or attention disorders. Over the course of my co-op, I handled everything from front-end and back-end
development to database upgrades, testing, documentation, and deployment to both the Apple and Google app stores. I also
regularly presented progress updates at weekly stand-ups. You can read more about CanPlan on the projects page.
