In my degree(Bachelor of Software Engineering), we’re required to undertake four Coop work terms(a total of 16 months). 

My first Coop experience was with the [Regional District of the Kootenay Boundary(RDKB)]({"https://rdkb.com"}), doing IT/IS work for the entire district. It was an amazing experience, and I got to learn a lot from my boss and colleagues, and since we were a smaller team I got to wear almost every hat imaginable like web-dev and others.
