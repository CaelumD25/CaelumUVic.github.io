Hi, my name is Caelum, and welcome to my website!



On this website, I wanted to display some of the projects I’ve worked on and the experiences I’ve accrued over the years while sharing a little about myself.



I’m in my final year of my Bachelor of Software Engineering at the University of Victoria, and doing my best to have a productive and healthy work-life balance. School can be all-consuming at times, but when I’m not spending 10 consecutive hours on some final project, I like to consistently get out and revel in some of my favourite hobbies. Some of those hobbies include bouldering, cycling, reading, or just spending time with friends!



Hopefully, you like the website, and if you’re more curious about some of the design decisions, I’ve included more in the projects section!
