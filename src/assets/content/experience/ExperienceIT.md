### IT Coop in Regional Government

My first Coop was with the Regional District of the Kootenay Boundary(RDKB) located near my childhood home in the shadows of the West Kootenays. At the RDKB, I worked in our very small IT team which consisted of myself and two to three other people, including my boss. Within this Coop, I learned a lot about public sector responsibility and gained experience with many technical skills such as web development and system administration. Further, I also:

*   Helped maintain communications and emergency messaging infrastructure for the 33,000+ residents of the Kootenay Boundary.
*   Facilitated the operations of essential and recreational services, such as fire, waste management, building inspection, zoning, pools, and hockey arenas.
*   Updated, maintained, and added features to the official Regional District of the Kootenay Boundary webpage.
