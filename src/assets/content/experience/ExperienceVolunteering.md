### Volunteering Experience

Throughout the years, Iâ€™ve spent hundreds of volunteering hours in public service such as hospitals and long-term care facilities, this work resulted in me receiving a citizenship award for my efforts. I spent so much time volunteering at these facilities because before I decided to be a software engineer, I had wanted a career in medicine, specifically respiratory therapy, and in the end, I decided not to pursue medicine, my desire to help others never faded. In these volunteering positions I:

*   Helped to run events, while managing the well-being of the attending residents/patients.
*   Practiced communication skills with those with problems communicating.
